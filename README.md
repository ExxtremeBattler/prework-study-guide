# Prework Study Guide

## Description

The purpose of this website is for bootcamp students to be able to refer to all their notes in a concise, efficient manner. This way, students will not have to scramble to different websites, documents, or videos in order to retrieve the info they require.

This project taught me a lot about CSS, JavaScript, Git, GitHub workflow, as well as HTML. 

## Installation

N/A, a simple browser will do.

## Usage

The notes for each topic are listed below their corresponding borders for your convenience and viewing pleasure. To recieve a suggestion on what to study, open up Chrome DevTools (shortcuts are Control + Shift + I on Windows, or Command + Option + I on Mac) and navigate to the 'Console' tab.

## Credits

The bootcamp for teaching me the skills required for this project,
